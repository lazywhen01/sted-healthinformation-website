				<p> The cardiovascular system, or circulatory system, circulates blood throughout your body,
					collaborating with your respiratory system to deliver oxygen-rich blood to your cells. Breathing
					commences as you inhale air through your nose or mouth, which then travels down your throat and
					enters the windpipe, known as the trachea, which branches into airways called bronchial tubes. </p>
				<p> For your lungs to perform their best, these airways need to be open. They should be free from
					inflammation or swelling and extra mucus. As the bronchial tubes traverse your lungs, they branch
					into smaller airways known as bronchioles, which terminate in small, balloon-like structures called
					alveoli. Your body contains approximately 600 million alveoli. These alveoli are encircled by a
					network of minute blood vessels called capillaries, where oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into your
					bloodstream.</p>
				<p> After absorbing oxygen, blood goes to your heart. Your heart then pumps it through your body to the
					cells of your tissues and organs. As the cells use the oxygen, they make carbon dioxide that goes
					into your blood. Your blood then carries the carbon dioxide back to your lungs, where it is removed
					from your body when you exhale.</p>
