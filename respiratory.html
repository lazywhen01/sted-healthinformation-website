				<p> The respiratory system is the biological system in organisms that enables breathing and exchange of
					gases between the body and the environment. It includes several organs and structures involved in
					the process of respiration, which is essential for supplying oxygen to the body's cells and removing
					carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism. The different organs of the respiratory
					system such as the nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, etc. carry out the process of
					respiration/breathing. All these organs play an important role in supplying oxygen to the body and
					allowing its smooth functioning.</p>

				<h2><a href="#">Quick Fact </a></h2>
				<p>The rate at which human beings breathe is 12-18 breaths per minute. There are 1440 minutes in 24
					hours, therefore, the average number of breaths drawn in by a human (at a rate of 12 breaths per
					minute) in a day is 17,280. The main function of the respiratory system is to allow gas exchange
					(oxygen and carbon dioxide) with different parts of the body. The different organs of the
					respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. These
					organs carry out the process of respiration.</p>
				<p>The respiratory system comprises the body’s organs and components responsible for the process of
					breathing, facilitating the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Every cell in your body requires
					oxygen for functioning. As they absorb oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide, known as a “waste gas,”
					which enters the bloodstream and is transported to the lungs. Upon exhalation, you release this
					carbon dioxide by breathing it out. This vital function is called “gas exchange,” and your body is
					set up to do it automatically.</p>

					<h2>Respiratory System Parts and its Functions</h2>
					<p>A detailed study of the respiratory system should help us understand the process of respiration.
						The functions of different organs in the respiratory system are presented below.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12">
							<table style="margin: auto;">
								<tr>
									<th>System Parts</th>
									<th>Functions</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Sinuses</td>
									<td>The sinuses are empty cavities within the skull bones, linked to the nasal
										passage by tiny openings. They assist in controlling the temperature and
										moisture levels of the air you inhale, while also reducing the weight of the
										skull and contributing to vocal resonance.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Nasal cavity</td>
									<td>Serves as the primary gateway for external air to enter your respiratory system.
										The hairs lining its interior wall play a role in the system’s air purification
										process.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Oral cavity</td>
									<td>Air can also enter through your mouth, known as the oral cavity, particularly in
										cases of habitual mouth breathing or temporary blockage of the nasal passages.
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Adenoids </td>
									<td>The adenoids are enlarged lymphoid tissue located at the upper part of the
										throat. In cases where they obstruct breathing, they may be surgically removed.
										The lymphatic system, comprising nodes and vessels, transports fluid throughout
										the body, aiding in infection resistance by filtering foreign substances, such
										as bacteria, and generating lymphocytes to combat them. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Tonsils</td>
									<td>The tonsils are lymph nodes located in the pharynx wall. They are not a crucial
										component of the body’s immune system. In cases of infection, they may be
										surgically removed.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Pharynx</td>
									<td>The pharynx, also known as the throat, gathers air entering from your nose and
										directs it downwards towards your trachea, or windpipe.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Epiglottis</td>
									<td>The epiglottis is a tissue flap that protects the opening of your trachea. It
										seals shut when swallowing to ensure that substances are directed to the
										esophagus and stomach, rather than the airway.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Larynx</td>
									<td>The larynx, or voice box, houses your vocal cords. As air moves in and out
										during breathing, it produces vocal sounds.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Esophagus</td>
									<td>The esophagus is the pathway that connects the mouth and throat to the stomach.
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Trachea</td>
									<td>The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is the passage that extends from the
										pharynx to the lungs.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Ribs</td>
									<td>The ribs are skeletal structures that provide support and protection to the
										chest cavity. They undergo slight movement and aid in the expansion and
										contraction of the lungs.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Bronchi</td>
									<td>The trachea splits into two primary tubes known as bronchi, with each one
										leading to a lung. These bronchi then branch out into smaller tubes called
										bronchioles.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Pleura</td>
									<td>The pleura consists of two membranes that enclose each lobe of the lungs,
										providing a separation between the lungs and the chest wall.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Cilia</td>
									<td>Cilia (like very small hairs) that have a wave-like motion.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Mucus</td>
									<td>A viscous liquid or sticky phlegm, is propelled upward and expelled into the
										throat where it is either coughed out or swallowed. It serves to trap and retain
										dust, germs, and other undesirable particles that have entered the lungs. The
										expulsion of mucus occurs through coughing, aiding in the removal of these
										substances from the lungs.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Diaphragm</td>
									<td>The strong wall of muscle that separates your chest cavity from your abdominal
										cavity. By moving downward, it creates suction to draw in air and expand the
										lungs.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Bronchioles</td>
									<td>The tiniest divisions of the bronchi, lead to the alveoli, which are small air
										sacs found at their terminus.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Alveoli</td>
									<td>The very small air sacs that are the destination of air that you breathe in.
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Capillaries </td>
									<td>Are blood vessels situated within the walls of the alveoli. Blood is carried to
										the capillaries by the pulmonary artery and then removed by the pulmonary vein.
										Within the capillaries, carbon dioxide is transferred into the alveoli, while
										oxygen is absorbed from the air within the alveoli.</td>
								</tr>

					<h2>How does the Respiratory System clean the air that we breath?</h2>
					<p> Your respiratory system possesses inherent mechanisms to prevent harmful substances in the air
						from reaching your lungs. The nose hairs aid in filtering out large particles, while small
						hair-like structures called cilia along the air passages continuously sweep to maintain
						cleanliness. However, exposure to harmful substances such as cigarette smoke can impair the
						function of cilia, potentially resulting in health issues such as bronchitis.</p>
					<p>Cells lining your trachea and bronchial tubes produce mucus, which moisturizes air passages and
						serves to prevent the entry of dust, bacteria, viruses, and allergens into your lungs. Mucus can
						bring up things that reach deeper into your lungs. You then cough out or swallow them.</p>
